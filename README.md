## Reflection

**1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**  
The goal was to design and implement a program that could store, sort, and search course information efficiently by selecting and applying the most appropriate data structures and algorithms.

**2. How did you approach the problem?**  
I first analyzed the behavior of several data structures—vector, hash table, and binary search tree—to understand their runtime and memory tradeoffs. I used pseudocode in Project One to compare each structure, then applied the binary search tree in Project Two because it supports efficient lookups while maintaining sorted order.

**3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**  
Most issues came from recursive logic and file-input handling. I resolved them by testing functions with small data sets, stepping through the code to verify pointer operations, and adjusting input parsing to handle spaces and quoted filenames.

**4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**  
It reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structure early in design. I learned to plan around algorithmic complexity and memory usage before writing code, which leads to cleaner, more predictable implementations.

**5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
I now focus on modular functions, clear commenting, and separating logic from data representation. These practices make the program easier to debug, extend, and reuse in future development.
